# Interface Segregation Principle

Ready for principle number 4? It's the interface segregation principle - or ISP.
It says:

> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces that they do not use.

That's not a bad definition! But I want to clarify that word "interface". It is
*not* necessarily referring to a *literal* interface. It's referring to the abstract
concept of an interface, which generally means "the public methods" of a class...
even if it doesn't technically implement an interface. The meaning of interface
*here* is: the "stuff that you can do with an object" when I give it to you.

## The Simpler Definition

So let me try to give this an even simpler definition:

> Build small, focused classes instead of big, giant classes.

This definition reminds me a lot of the single responsibility principle... and that's
true! But the interface segregation principle kind of looks at this from the other
direction: from the perspective of who *uses* the class, not from the perspective
of the class itself. Again, the original definition is:

> *Clients* should not be forced to depend upon interfaces - so basically methods -
> that they do not use.

For example, suppose you've accidentally built a giant class called `ProductManager`
with a *ton* of methods on it. Whoops! Then, somewhere in your code, you need to
call just *one* of those methods. This other class is called the "client" because it
is *using* our giant `ProductManager` class. And unfortunately, even though it only
needs one method from the `ProductManager`, it needs to inject the whole giant object.
It's forced to depend on an object whose interface - whose public methods - are
many more than it actually needs.

## New Feature: Adjusting a Score

Why is this a problem? Let's answer that question a bit later after we play with
a real world example. Because... management has asked us to make yet *another* change
to our believability score system! If a sighting receives a score of *less*
than 50 points... but it has three or more photos, we will give it a boost: 5 extra
points per photo. This... was not a change we anticipated! Darn! Our scoring
factors *do* have the ability to add to the score... but they *don't* have the ability
to *see* the final score and then modify it.

## Adding another Method to the Interface

No problem: let's add a second method to the interface that has the ability to do
that. Call it, how about, public function `adjustScore()`. In this case, it's
going to receive the `int $finalScore` that's just been calculated and the
`BigFootSighting` that we're scoring. It will return the new `int` final score.
You can add some PHPDoc above this to better explain the purpose of the method
if you want.

[[[ code('6a2ac553fb') ]]]

In a minute, we're going to call this from inside of `SightingScorer` *after*
the initial scoring is done. But first, let's open `PhotoFactor` and add the new
bonus logic.

## Implementing the new Method

At the bottom, go to Code -> Generate - or Command + N on a Mac - select
"Implement Methods" and implement `adjustScore()`. Say
`$photosCount = $sighting->getImages()` - don't forget to *count* these - then if
the `$finalScore` is less than 50 and `$photosCount` is greater than two - the
`$finalScore` should get plus equals `$photosCount * 5`. At the bottom, return
`$finalScore`.

[[[ code('24c0f6cfa3') ]]]

New logic done! But now... what do we do with all the other classes that implement
`ScoringFactorInterface`? Unfortunately, for PHP to even run, we do need to add the
new method to *each* class. But we can just make it return `$finalScore`.

So at the bottom of `CoordinatesFactor`, go back to Code -> Generate - select
"Implement Methods", generate `adjustScore()`, and return `$finalScore`. 

[[[ code('905615159b') ]]]

Copy, this close `CoordinatesFactor`, go to `DescriptionFactor` and add it to the bottom.
Do the same thing inside of `TitleFactor`.

[[[ code('d13c43c3d4') ]]]

*Finally*, we can update `SightingScorer`. Add a second loop after calculating the
score: for each `$this->scoringFactors` as `$scoringFactor`, this time say
`$score = $scoringFactor->adjustScore()`... and pass in `$score` and `$sighting`.

[[[ code('66a2d611fa') ]]]

Done! By the way, you might argue that the *order* of scoring factors is now
relevant. That's true! But... we're not going to worry about that for simplicity...
and because that isn't relevant to this principle. But, there *is* a way to give
a tagged service a higher priority in Symfony so that it is passed earlier or later
than other scoring factors.

## We Violated OCP!

If, at this point, something is itching you, that might be because we just violated
the open-closed principle! We had to modify the `score()` method in order to add
this new behavior. But that's okay! It highlights the tricky nature of OCP: we didn't
anticipate this kind of change! You can't "close" a class against *all* kinds of
changes: you can only close it against the changes that you correctly predict.

Looking at our new interface and the classes that implement it, you can probably
feel that it's not... *ideal* that all of these classes need to implement this
method... even though they don't really *care* about it. Next: we're going to
make this even *more* obvious, refactor to a better solution, and finally discuss
the key takeaways from the interface segregation principle.
